Problem Statement
=================

Debt is a large problem in the United States. Many people have fallen into large
amounts of debt much of which have a staggering interest rate attached to it. A
significant number of these people have chosen not to repay this debt. This can
be attributed to any number of reasons (loss of employment, other costs taking
precedence, with the interest being so high they don't see any reduction in the
principle amount, etc…) After a period of time trying to collect on the debt
creditors will write this debt off and sell it in hopes of recouping some of
what is owed. The process by which debt is sold comes in the form of bundles
i.e., a number of different debtors are bound together and sold as a percentage
of the total amount owed. This could me pennies on the dollar, but the amount
paid varies on the amount of information given to the buyer about the debtors
included in the bundle. For instance all statements and correspondence each
debtor has had with the selling creditor. The more data provided the more the
bundle will cost, however the more data you have the better you will be able to
predict if someone will eventually repay what is owed.

 

Getting people who have a demonstrated propensity of ignoring their debts to pay
is the key to success when purchasing bundles of debt. How then do we do this?
It is our belief that for the most part people in this position would like a way
out. Either to just have the load of the debt off their shoulders, or to get the
credit back so they my buy a house, car, etc… What has was implemented
successfully in this bundle was to reduce the interest rate to prime plus 3 for
debtors meeting the following criteria:

-   Debt must be in Colorado

-   Amount must be less then or equal to \$15,000

 

The goal of this Capstone is to predict if debtor will repay loan. We have two
bundles of debt that were purchased in 2008. These bundles is comprised of 86
debtors with a total debt amount of \$. We also know who in fact accepted the
deal to repay.
